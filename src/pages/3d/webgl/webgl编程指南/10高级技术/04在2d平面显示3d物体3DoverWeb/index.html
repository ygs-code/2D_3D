        <h2>Great Designs Come from Great Designers --- Not from Great Design Processes</h2>

        <p>The basic premise underlying the SEI's [Software
            Engineering Institute] work on software process maturity
            is that the quality of a software product is largely
            determined by the quality of the software development
            and maintenance processes used to build it.</p>

        Mark Paulk [1995], "The evolution of the SEI's capability maturity model for software"

        <p>...[W]hile some may see them as the crazy ones, we see
            genius, because the ones who are crazy enough to think
            that they can change the world, are the ones who do.</p>

        Steve Jobs, Apple commercial (1997)
